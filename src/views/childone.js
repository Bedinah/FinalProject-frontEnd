            The intestinal microbiome of infants requires a high proportion of
            Bifidobacteria during the first year of life to aid in the digestion
            of milk. Breast milk harbours a diverse microbiota, plus nutrients
            that encourage the proliferation of health-promoting bacteria. For
            example, prebiotic HMOs are specifically metabolised by bacteria in
            the infant gut, strongly favouring the proliferation of
            bifidobacteria.1 It has been estimated that 25â€“30% of the infant
            bacterial microbiota originates from breast milk.

              What is our microbiome?
            </Title>
            Our bodies provide a home for a vast range of micro-organisms,
            including bacteria, fungi an d viruses. Collectively, these are
            known as the human microbiota. Our microbiome is the collection of
            genomes from all the micro-organisms and are specific to each
            person. Some micro-organisms are disease-causing, and others only
            become detrimental to our health if they are able to proliferate.
            Others can be beneficial to the body in many ways. In a healthy
            person, these micro-organisms are balanced and coexist peacefully.
